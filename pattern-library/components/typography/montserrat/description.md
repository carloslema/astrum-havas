The Donwload needs clear and consistent headings, highly legible body paragraphs, clear labels, and easy-to-use input fields. We recommend Monserrat for its clean design, weight choices and it can beautifully adapt to a variety of visual styles.

Monserrat was designed by Julieta Ulanovsky, graphic designer and owner of ZkySky, in Montserrat, the first and oldest neighborhood in Buenos Aires.

The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century.
