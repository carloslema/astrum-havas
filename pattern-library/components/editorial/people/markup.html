    <li>Use Ph.D. and M.D., instead of Dr.</li>
    <li>Include titles such as Jr., Sr., that are part of a person’s name on first reference only, unless necessary for clarification later. Do not precede with a comma.</li>
    <li>Capitalized titles when they precede someone’s name: Vice President of Sales John Clarke. But: John Clarke, vice president of sales. If the title simply refers to someone’s role (analyst Joe Smith), the title should be lowercase.</li>
